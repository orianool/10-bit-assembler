# 32-bit-assembler
School project - 32 bit assembler

This is project 

The goal was to creat a compiler that translates source code written in an imaginary assembley language \(with syntex symilar to MIPS Assembley language\) into machine language.
the machine was also an imaginary and used a 10 bit architecture.
