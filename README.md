# 32-bit-assembler
School project - 32 bit assembler

This is project 

The goal of this project was to create a compiler that translates source code written in an imaginary assembley language \(with syntex symilar to MIPS Assembley language\) into machine language.
the machine was also an imaginary and used a 10 bit architecture.

The machine has a CPU able to process 10 bit istructions \(obviasly\), 8 register, and 256 byte of memory.
This architecture supports the basic instructions you would expect and can use the following addressing methods:
