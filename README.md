# 32-bit-assembler
School project - 32 bit assembler

This is project 

The goal of this project was to create a compiler that translates source code written in an imaginary assembley language \(with syntex symilar to MIPS Assembley language\) into machine language.

The machine is also imaginary and has a 10 bit architecture. The istructions are of course 10 bit long and the machine has 8 general purpose registers and 256 "cells" of memory \(each "cell" is 10 bits\).
This architecture supports the basic instructions you would expect and can use the following addressing methods:
  1.
